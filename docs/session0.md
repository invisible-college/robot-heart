# Session 0: Write your first Android app

So you want to write an Android app, but you don't know where to start?
We're here to help, mob programming style.

# Agenda

* Introductions: who am I, why are we here
* Download and install Android Studio
* Create an empty project
* Add a new text view and image.
* Compile and run on an emulator / device
* Create a new keystore
* Sign the app and upload it
* Celebrate! Where to go next.

# Goals

By the time you're done, you'll have

* a working Android dev environment installed on your computer (running Mac, Windows, or Linux)
* a working "Hello World" Android app that runs in an emulator
* the same app that you can download from the Google Play store.

# Pre-work

* Download and install the [http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html](Android Studio IDE 1.4), which also includes the Android SDK.
* As you are setting up Android Studio, you'll need to select SDK packages to
install. These are the packages you should select:
