So you want to write an Android app, but you don't know where to start?
We're here to help, mob programming style.

# Goals

By the time you're done, you'll have

* a working "Hello World" Android app that runs in an emulator
* the same app that you can download from the Google Play store.

# Pre-work

* Download and install the [Android Studio IDE 1.5.1](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html), which also includes the Android SDK.
* As you are setting up Android Studio, you'll need to select SDK packages to
install. These are the packages you should select:
