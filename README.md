Adventures in Java and Android, an open curriculum from the Invisible College.
https://invisible.college/

Have a great idea for an app? Need to code up the minimum viable product for your startup? Do you want to compete in the Global Learning XPRIZE but don't know where to start?

We've designed this course for you. Someone who's curious about Android, the mobile operating system running on the majority of devices around the world including smartphones, tablets, Amazon’s Kindle Fire, watches, and more to come. Someone who knows a little programming, but needs coaching and accountability to be your best. Learn more about how to control this modern pocket robot of yours, and the heart that makes it tick.

## Pre-requisites: This is course is for people who already know Java and need a review, or people who know another programming language and just need to practice syntax. If you need a gentler introduction, try Codecademy's new Java track.

In this 9-session, 3 week course, you’ll learn the following key concepts. You’ll go from being a Java novice to uploading three Android apps to an online store, ready for your adoring fans and future customers. Our teaching style will use mob programming so that the whole class codes together, learns by practicing, and stays engaged the whole time. You'll receive individual, hands-on attention from our three expert mentors with years of industry and teaching experience.
